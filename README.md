# hello-world

Hi ðŸ‘‹

First time in GitHub and I'm trying to learn how it works.

I'm having a difficult time to understand what I need to do especially as Dorian is distracting me from what I need to learn.

He's 2y 5m old today! ðŸ¥³

And our second one (Spitz) is 1m old (still in he's mommy belly). Can't wait to meet him ðŸ¤—

Back to work now.
